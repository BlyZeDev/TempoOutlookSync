## TempoOutlookSync

- This application requires to have Classic Outlook to be installed **and running**, because it uses COM objects to avoid the Graph API.
- This application requires you to provide your Jira UserId, Email and ApiToken as well as your Tempo API Token at the first startup.

The application runs in the background and syncs your Capacity Planner Times into the Outlook Calendar.
